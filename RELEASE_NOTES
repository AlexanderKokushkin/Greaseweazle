************************************

** v0.6 - 15 November 2019
 - gw.py: Big overhaul of underlying Python package
   - Action (read, write, update) must come first on the command line
   - eg. "python3 gw.py read --ecyl=39 foo.scp COM3"
 - gw.py: New action "delays" to print/set delay parameters
   - eg. "python3 gw.py delays --step=10000" to increase step time to 10ms

** v0.5 - 11 November 2019
 - USB: Overhaul the protocol and allow writes to be terminated at index
   - Terminate-at-index is always used by current Python control script
   - Terminate-at-index prevents an over-long write from overwriting itself
   - Fix interruption of track writes (eg. KeyboardInterrupt)
 - gw.py: New option --adjust-speed to normalise flux times for target drive
   - Measures RPM of the target drive and calculates an adjustment factor

   - https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle/wiki/STM32-Fakes
